I'm Benjamin, a Computer Engineering student from Santiago, Chile.

My primary focus is on **Machine Learning Engineering**, with a keen interest in Deep Learning and Computer Vision. I am also passionate about Software Engineering, especially backend development, and exploring how **Machine Learning intersects with hardware** and diverse fields such as Psychology, Sociology, and **Physics**. I am actively seeking opportunities to collaborate on impactful projects that positively influence society and the environment. 

In my leisure time, I enjoy watching series, practicing artistic gymnastics, seeing Lex Fridman podcasts and playing video games.

So, if you are interested in collaborating on a project, discussing a topic, or just want to chat, feel free to reach out!
